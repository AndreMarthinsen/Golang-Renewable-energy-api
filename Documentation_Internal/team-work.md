# Team-work Conventions

### Weekly Contribution
- All members are expected to contribute ~2 hours a day throughout the project period.
- Members are expected to make an effort to keep themselves up-to-date on the project status.

### Weekly Meetings and Work Sessions
- Weekly work is organized in sprints starting monday, ending (roughly) on friday.
- Mondays 10:00 - 14:00: Weekly planning and work session
- Fridays 12:00 - 16:00: Weekly summary, pre-planning of monday sessions + work session
- Ad-hoc video/discord sessions when needed

### Peer Review Process
- Merge requests should be used to signal that your branch is ready for a review along with a discord message.
- A merge request can be done, marked as draft, if you want input prior to completion of your branch.
- All group members should give input on branches ready to be merged into the main branch.
- Focal points of Peer Review:
- - Spotting potential bugs
- - Testing of APIs
- - Ensuring conventions are followed
- - Spotting ways to further modularize code, such as lifting logic into new re-usable sub-routines
- - Potential for simplification
- Reviewers should provide potential solutions, not just point out problems.
- Code presented for review is expected to be in a presentable state with comments and a clean structure.

### Communications Platform
- Discord for general communication.
- Git comments for peer-review and remarks on code in general.
- Members are expected to subscribe to git issue labels.
- Might meet physically once in a while.
